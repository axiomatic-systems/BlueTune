BlueTune Media Framework 
    --- Examples ---
------------------------

1. Example Code

The BlueTune distribution includes a number of sample application that
illustrate the use of the API.

1.1 BtPlay

This application shows how to use the low-level synchronous decoding API
in a command line application. The application is invoked with command line
arguments that can set various options, and a list of name of inputs to play
(such as file names, URLs, etc...). The application will play all inputs
sequentially, and exit.

1.2 BtController

This application shows how to use the high-level asynchronous player API in 
a command line application. The application is invoked from the command line, 
and takes commands on its text input. See the source code for a list of
commands and their syntax. All even notifications from the playback thread 
are also displayed on the text output.

1.3 BtGtk

This application shows how to use the high-level asynchronous player API in 
a GTK application. This application shows a simple dialog box with a menu
to choose a file, and a text box to choose an non-file input name. The 
dialog controls also include motion control buttons (play, stop, ...) and 
a seek bar. The lower part of the dialog window shows properties of the stream
that is being played.

1.4 BtMfcGui

This application shows how to use the high-level asynchronous player API in 
a MFC GUI application (Windows). 
This application shows a simple dialog box with a button to choose a file, 
and a text box to choose an non-file input name. 
The dialog controls also include motion control buttons (play, stop, ...) and 
a seek bar. The lower part of the dialog window shows properties of the stream
that is being played.
