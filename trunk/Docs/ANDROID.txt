BlueTune for Android

1. Building BlueTune for Android

1.a Requirements
  Android NDK r8 or above
  Android SDK
  
1.b Build the main runtime

Follow the build instructions in order to build the target 'arm-android-linux' and/or 'x86-android-linux' in 'Release' and 'Debug' mode.
This will produce a number of .a libraries under 
Build/Targets/arm-android-linux/Release and Build/Targets/arm-android-linux/Release 
and/or
Build/Targets/x86-android-linux/Release and Build/Targets/x86-android-linux/Release 

1.c Build the JNI layer

Go to Source/Platform/Android/modules/bluetune
build with the command 'ndk-build' (make sure that the NDK directory is in your path)

You can pass the option 'NDK_DEBUG=1' to use the debug mode (in this case you need to have built the 'Debug' release of the BlueTune runtime)
You can pass the option APP_ABI=<abi> if you want to build for more than just the default architecture (arm)
This will produce a JAR file and one or more shared library(ies) (.so):
bin/bluetune.jar
libs/armeabi/libbluetune-jni.so
libs/x86/libbluetune-jni.so 

You can use this NDK module (Source/Platform/Android/modules/bluetune) as a dependency in your own Android application or module.
This way, your application will pull in the Java classes in bluetune.jar as well as the JNI runtime library libbluetune-jni.so

For an example, see the 'simple-player' sample application

2. Simple Player sample app

This is a sample GUI application that shows how to use the BlueTune player API (defined in bluetune.jar)
This application has a dependency on the bluetune runtime module.
An Eclipse project is provided both for the bluetune module (Source/Platform/Android/modules/bluetune/.project)
and for the simple player example (Source/Platform/Androi/samples/simple-player/.project)
